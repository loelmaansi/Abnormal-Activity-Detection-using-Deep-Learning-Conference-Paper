# 🚀 Abnormal-Activity-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-Conference-Paper

🔍 Identifying abnormal activities is crucial for security, but manually detecting such events is **time-consuming**. This project leverages **Deep Learning** to automate **surveillance** and detect real-world incidents like **accidents 🚗, burglary 🏠, explosions 💥, fights 🥊, and robbery 💰**.  

## ✨ Our Approach  

We implemented **two** powerful approaches to achieve high accuracy:  

### 1️⃣ Auto-Encoder (Spatiotemporal 3D CNN)  
🧠 A deep learning model based on a **3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained to reconstruct frames with:  
✅ **Minimum loss:** 8%  
✅ **Maximum accuracy:** 71%  

### 2️⃣ C3D Feature Extraction (Pre-trained Model)  
🔬 Extracts features from **fully connected layers** of **C3D (Convolutional 3D Network)**, leading to:  
✅ **Improved accuracy** 📈  
✅ **Reduced reconstruction loss** 📉  

## 🎯 Applications  
🔹 **Automated surveillance** in **banks 🏦, roads 🛣️, and crowded areas 🎥**  
🔹 **Real-time anomaly detection** via **CCTV cameras** 📹  
🔹 **Enhancing security** by detecting critical events **without human intervention** 🛡️
